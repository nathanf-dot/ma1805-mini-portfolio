As a drummer, for this prompt, I wanted to see if I could create a mini, digitalised version of the instrument which I love so much. I originally had the idea to use three components of a drum kit, to which I reached a road block and was unable to work out how to correctly map each sound to a specific region of the screen that is clicked. I decided to try out with only one component which was succesful and following some research, I was, inevitably, able to work out how to map a different drum sound to a specific image using the parameters around the generated image.
