I had difficulty meeting the exact criteria for this prompt, and so with this project, I wanted to focus on demonstrating visual and technical proficiency with p5.js. In this prompt I wanted to create an image that made a gradient through the use of shapes namely squares going in a diagonal across the screen. abstractly this could represent the change of human emotion as the colour gradient symbolises this shift.
